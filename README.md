Course Title: Simulation and Modeling Lab 

</b>

<b>Overview</b>

— This repository serves the purpose of gathering the Simulation and Modeling Lab tasks in one place. 

— Here, we're simulating and visualizing mathematical functions and data using NumPy, Panda, Matplotlib and Seaborn Library of Python.

— This lab will cover graphical representation of mathematical functions using Python. In addition to that, it will serve as a gataway to venture cocepts like Data Science, Machine Learning etc. 


<b>Tools & Libraries:</b>

NumPy: For numerical computations and simulations.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: For producing aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
